  <h4>THE REVOLUTION OF EDUCATION IN ZAMBIA</h4>
  <p><b>Access to education</b> Zambia's education system aims to ensure that all individuals have access to education and can participate in it. The country's Right to Education Act guarantees free basic education for all children, prohibits discrimination, and ensures equal access. <b>Education pathways</b> Children in Zambia typically start preschool at age 2 or 3, and then move on to primary school between ages 5 and 7. Secondary school begins between ages 11 and 14, and students typically finish around age 18 or older. <b>Higher education</b> The number of private universities and colleges in Zambia has increased in recent years, which has improved higher education. <b>Social studies</b> The social studies curriculum in Zambia integrates the social sciences and humanities to help students develop civic competence. <b>Teaching methods</b> Some schools in Zambia are using playful and hands-on teaching methods to engage students and help them learn. <b>Challenges</b> Zambia's education system faces challenges such as inadequate resources, poor-quality education, and a lack of resilience during emergencies.
